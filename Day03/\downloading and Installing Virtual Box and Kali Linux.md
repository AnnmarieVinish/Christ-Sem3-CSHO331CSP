TO DOWNLOAD VIRTUAL BOX
1. Visit https://virtualbox.org
2. Go to the downloads section and choose your OS

Problems I faced:
Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.12 required the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package to be installed on my Windows system.

How I resolved it:
I downloaded it from this link: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
And then I ran the installer again

TO DOWNLOAD KALI LINUX

3. Choose "Virtual Box".
4. This will start the download
5. Go to your downloads section [in file explorer] and find the zip file "kali-linux-2025.2-virtualbox-amd64".
6. Extract all the files from that zip file
7. You will then be able to see a folder with the same name; the difference is that this folder is not zipped
8. Go to that folder, and you will be able to see two files: vbox and vdi
9. Click on the VBox file, and this will run Kali Linux on VirtualBox.
10. Now we need to boot Kali Linux. For that, double click on the Kali Linux section that you see on the top left of VirtualBox after you click on the Vbox file.
11. You have successfully installed and booted Kali Linux.

Problems I faced:
I had not unzipped the file when I booted it for the first time, which resulted in an error.

How I resolved it:
I unzipped the file and tried again.
